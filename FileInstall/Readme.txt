PPSSPP 100% Checklist by NABN00B
with contributions by Parik

This derivative of Lighnat0r's 100% Checklist has been modified to work with the 64 bit version of
PPSSPP in order to implement support for Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories and Vice City Stories.

########################################### COMPATIBILITY ############################################

PPSSPP:
- 64 bit executable ONLY (PPSSPPWindows64.exe)
- v1.4 or newer stable releases
- standard or Gold edition

Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories:
- ULUS10041_1.05_ARTiSAN only

Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories:
- ULUS10160_1.03_Start2
- ULES00502_1.02_pSyPSP
- ULES00503_1.02_Googlecus
- (% only) ULJM05297_1.01_Caravan / ULJM05884_1.00_Pussycat

When using an unsupported game or version, the values displayed will be "junk". If using an unsuppor-
ted game version where the script is still the same, only the percentage value will be junk.

############################################ KNOWN ISSUES ############################################

- Increasing the font size will introduce empty spaces on the bottom of the checklist window. For now
  you will have to trim it off in your recording software or stick with the default size.
- Increasing the font size will cause the columns to be sized incorrectly in Text output mode. Requi-
  res further investigation.
- If the checklist fails to hook into PPSSPPWindows64.exe, then the check for admin rights might fail?
  Requires further investigation.
- Auto update feature is not yet updated to work with PPSSPP 100% Checklist, so it has been disabled.

Issues carried over from Lighnat0r's 100% Checklist:
- 100% transparency will make clicks fall through the welcome screen. For navigation click on the win-
  dow's header, and press Tab and the Cursor Keys to toggle between elements and Spacebar to confirm/
  toggle selection.
- Changing the size of GUI elements in Windows Accessibility Settings breaks the layout of the check-
  list window.
- OBS window capture will show a black box instead of the application's current window after the tool
  is restarted. The window capture needs to be refreshed after every restart.

Quoted from Lighnat0r's "100% Checklist Readme.txt":
- 100% transparency will make everything that has the same colour as the background transparent. (For
  this reason, when using transparency don't set the background colour to the same as the text co-
  lour.) This could also make (parts of) icons transparent.
- If you resize the window in OBS, there will be a one pixel border around the text, in a colour very
  similar to the background colour. To counter this, change the background colour to something more to
  your liking (not the same as text colour, see the issue above). Using the right background colour
  might even make the text even more readable. This issue seems to be specific to OBS, not sure if I
  can do anything to solve it.
- When using transparency the preview icon in Windows Peek and the alt-tab menu shows a box in the
  background colour instead of what the program actually looks like.
- The semi-transparent background might glitch out if you're restarting the program while it is inac-
  tive. The only solution I know of is to make the window always on top and I don't want to do that.

############################################# CHANGELOG ##############################################

20221217:

  ror message and restarting.
- ENGINE: Game version control is now run on every update cycle.
- GUI: The output status text now displays the detected game version, or the detected PPSSPP version,
  if no game version was recognized.

  ress of a PPSSPP v1.14+ process via window messages. https://github.com/hrydgard/ppsspp/pull/15748

- PPSSPP: Added base offsets for v1.13.2 and v1.14 when checking the emulator version manually.
- GTAVCS: Implemented version control. The tool now recognizes the following disc versions: 
  ULUS10160_1.03_Start2, ULES00502_1.02_pSyPSP, ULES00503_1.02_Googlecus, ULJM05297_1.01_Caravan /
  ULJM05884_1.00_Pussycat. Support for the Japanese versions are currently limited to percentage only.
- GTAVCS: Paramedic is now recognized as done if the player has infinite sprint.
- README: The content of the previous "Enhancements" section of is now listed under the changelog for
  v2021.0406 instead.
- README: Unified the formatting of the "Changelog" section

2022.0729:

  this.
